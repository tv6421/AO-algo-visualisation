# Visualisation of AO* algorithm for AND/OR graphs

## Simulation guide   
First the user must select the correct node that needs to be developed

Upon selecting the wrong node the cost inputs are disabled until the correct node gets selected

When the user enters the right node and values they can proceed to the next step

When the algorithm finishes the tree is marked in light green

Also the output is printed in the console

If the user has trouble with finding the right solution the "Help" button might be useful 
![help_window](https://github.com/tv6421/AO-algo-visualisation/blob/main/example_images/help_window.PNG)   
(there is also a "Skip" button next to it that automatically skips to the next step of the algorithm)    

> TIPS: The final nodes of the tree have another circle inside them. 5 different example trees might be used to start the algorithm and the user may also edit the starting graph and heuristics.
